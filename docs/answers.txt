When you want to add a new feature or fix a bug—no matter how big or how small—you spawn a new branch to encapsulate your changes
 Git branches are effectively a pointer to a snapshot of your changes

5.

The git log command displays committed snapshots. It lets you list the project history, filter it, and search for specific changes.
git status lets you inspect the working directory and the staging area, git log only operates on the committed history.
